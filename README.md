### File System Orginization Outline
#### There will be two folders and two documents in the main view 

1. **documentations (folder)**: <br>
contains the documentation process of the website including the resources used to create and develop it, checkpoints, and all other comments. 

2. **library_website_src (folder)**: <br>
contains all the components that make up the librarys website. 

3. **.gitignore (doc)** <br>
ignore file to keep from commiting certain technologies or documents

4. **README.md (doc)** <br>
documentation about everything you need to know about the library website


Our goal is to keep everything organized and modular as possible.
